# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: My code used a mathematical way to implement. The given one used a lot of helper method.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: use a random number and some if statement. 
Also, the area are the same, but I will let the width to be random and length will be area/width


-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I think I need to finish the draw room method first. 


-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: the width of a hallway is only limited to 1 and 2, where the room can be random width that greater than 1 and 2.
